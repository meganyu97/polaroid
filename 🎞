i participate in the millennial forum 
adding to the bulletin decorations
of pictures proving the existence of the lives we wish to display

my bookshelves are flooded with photo albums
the birthdays, the graduations, the piano recitals
but there are no photos that capture the way i felt
when i cried myself to sleep masking the sound with rain drops tapping on my window
when i told someone "i love you" for the first time
when i first heard it back
when i opened my first college acceptance letter
when i flunked my calculus test 
when i got my dream job offer
when i got my heart lifted up to cloud nine 
only to be dropped onto the ground into a million pieces

we've become attached to the routine of capturing our existence on film 
when memories don't always fit into a polaroid 
and we're forced to put the camera down
and just live.
